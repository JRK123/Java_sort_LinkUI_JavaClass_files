# Java_sort_LinkUI_JavaClass_files
Wonder full project where I learnt how double-clicking opens the Icon


Needs Pygtk pakages to be installed.
Run program in terminal as sorrt.py
This project is mixture of java+python coding
sorting algorithms are implemented in java.
A basic UI is designed in python using pygtk library.
